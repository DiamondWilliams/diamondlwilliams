        <h2>Thoughts on Leadership</h2>
        <p>Leadership means being able to get everyone to express their ideas whether or not it is good or bad and supporting the ideas that help to further a goal that we have been working toward. Also I feel as if it means to not control people but the environment because I do not believe that it should be too much of a dictatorship more of  a democracy.

        <h3>Thoughts on Teamwork</h3>
        <p>Teamwork means not only working together but listening as well because someone could be working hard with someone else but nothing will truly get accomplished if no one is listening or putting ideas out there.</p>
